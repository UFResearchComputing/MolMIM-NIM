    "\n",
    "1. /embedding - Retrieve the embeddings from MolMIM for a given input molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. /hidden - Retrieve the hidden state from MolMIM for a given input molecule (shown as the \u001c",
    "latent code\u001d",
    " in Figure 1 of the MolMIM manuscript).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. /decode - Decode a hidden state representation into a SMILES string sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. /sampling - Sample the latent space within a given scaled radius from a seed molecule. This method generates new molecule samples from the given input in an unguided fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. /generate - Generate novel molecules (optionally while optimizing against a certain property). This method generates new optimized molecules if CMA-ES-guided sampling is enabled."

    "# Benchmarking\n",
    "Benchmarking the accuracy and performance of autoencoder-style models, such as MolMIM, is crucial to evaluate their effectiveness. Accuracy can be measured by evaluating the reconstruction accuracy, which is the ability of the model to accurately generate the original input SMILES string from its encoded representation. Performance can be measured by the time it takes for the model to generate the output starting from the input, which is known as the decoding time. The script provided below demonstrates how to benchmark the accuracy and performance of such a model for a single SMILES string example. It sends a POST request to the model's `/hidden` endpoint to encode the input SMILES string, and then sends another POST request to the `/decode` endpoint to decode the encoded representation back into a SMILES string. The script measures the time it takes for each of these steps and checks if the generated SMILES string matches the original input. This script can be easily extended to cover multiple SMILES strings by modifying the `smiles` variable and sending multiple requests to the model's endpoints."
